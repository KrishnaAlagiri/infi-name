## About
A simple mobile app developed entirely on Flutter Mobile SDK that generates an endless list of proposed names for a startup company, events etc. The user can also select and unselect names (as shown in the Screenshot below), saving the best ones. This is my first Flutter Application. Flutter Mobile SDK provides high-quality native interfaces on iOS and Android in record time.
